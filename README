This repository contains processing scripts for preparing ISMIP6 archive data
for input to Sea Level Model.  The shell script pre-process-ismip6-run.sh
needs to be modified at the top to set the experiment you want to process.
It assumes that the ISMIP6 archive has already been downloaded locally.
It is also necessary to manually copy four files to the directory where
the repository is cloned:
* etopo2_512_orig
* GLlat_512.txt
* GLlon_512.txt
* mapfile_polarRank2_to_gaussRank2.nc
On Badger these files can be found at:
/lustre/scratch4/turquoise/mhoffman/ISMIP6_SLM_Processing_MJH
